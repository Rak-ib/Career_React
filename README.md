# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# MCQ

# 1st Question's Answer:

The answer is A {}. Because the variable is declared as object by using the sign {}. through it is empty 
inside, JS will print only the bracket 

# 2nd Question's Answer:

Here you have no correct ans but if you consol the sum(1,"2") the answer will be a string "12".
We know that if we add an int and a string the JS will convert by default the int as string.

# 3rd Question's Answer:

Here the correct ans is option A. Because by assigning value in info.favoriteFood we are not changing the value of food[0]. In declaration of

                const info = { favoriteFood: food[0]}

we are just assigning a copy of food from the food array. And by by assigning 4

                info.favoriteFood = "üçù"
                
we are just changing that copy not the food in food array.

# 4th Question's Answer:

The correct option is  option B. As we didn't pass any parameter in the sayHi() function the function name will be undefined. It can be assumed like this,we declared a variable like
        const name;
and printed it in the console. so the output will be undefined

# 5th Question's Answer:

The correct answer is option C . As the are 4 number in the array and the count=0, so for four number's the count should be 4 but the first number is 0, and in condition 0 is taken as false.
So in if condition for 0 integer the count variable will not increase. As a result it will be 3
